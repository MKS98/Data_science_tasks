    "# Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "\n",
    "CLT is a statistical premise that, given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all sampled variables from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the whole population. Furthermore, these samples approximate a normal distribution, with their variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population as the sample size gets larger, according to the law of large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1-The central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are often considered sufficient for the CLT to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- A key aspect of CLT is that the average of the sample means and standard deviations will equal the population mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-A sufficiently large sample size can predict the characteristics of a population more accurately.\n",
