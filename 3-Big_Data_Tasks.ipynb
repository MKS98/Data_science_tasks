    "# Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.** \n",

    "### the difference between Reinforcement learning and Supervised learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning:** Reinforcement learning is all about making decisions sequentially. In simple words, we can say that the output depends on the state of the current input and the next input depends on the output of the previous input, **In Reinforcement learning** decision is dependent, So we give labels to sequences of dependent decisions. **Example: Chess game**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning:** In Supervised learning, the decision is made on the initial input or the input given at the start, **In supervised learning** the decisions are independent of each other so labels are given to each decision. **Example: Object recognition**\n",

    "Reverse engineering represents a process of disassembling a physical model and recreating a logical model from it. This process extracts information from an existing data source to create a new logical model that can be analyzed. Reverse engineering specifically, only live databases can be used as a data source (vs SQL scripts or ApexSQL schema snapshots).\n",

    "# Neuroevolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neuroevolution** is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate artificial neural networks (ANN), parameters, topology and rules. It is most commonly applied in artificial life, general game playing and evolutionary robotics. The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning algorithms, which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs. In contrast, neuroevolution requires only a measure of a network's performance at a task. For example, the outcome of a game (i.e. whether one player won or lost) can be easily measured without providing labeled examples of desired strategies. Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology."

    "\n",
    "**genetic algorithm (GA)** is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. Some examples of GA applications include optimizing decision trees for better performance, automatically solve sudoku puzzles, hyperparameter optimization, etc."
